# The Problem

Material tracking is a critical component of construction management. If materials are not approved and procured/delivered on time, projects can face significant schedule delays and cost impacts.

For example, if a general contractor forgets to submit/request delivery for a material and it comes two weeks past the project deadline, the GC may have negative impacts like:
- extra time by subcontractors to install material. If, say, the labor to install is a two person crew that costs $200/hour, that could be $8,000 for a week's worth of work
- extra cost for the GC to staff the project, which can be several thousand dollars a week as well
- possible liquidated damage fees imposed by the owner. These can range from small dollar values of $100-$500 / day to exorbitant values of hunderds of thousands of dollars or more per day
- damaged relationships with the owner team due to material/project mismanagement

GCs understandably want to avoid the above damages, and do so by creating and managing two documents: material procurement logs and submittal logs.

Material procurement logs list out the most important materials on the job, and provide detail about the material such as:
- Who is responsible for procuring the product
- When the product is needed on the project site
- When the product needs to be submitted for architect/owner approval, based on when it is needed and how long review will take
- Whether the material has been procured, stockpiled and/or delivered

Submittal logs list out what data needs to be approved by the architect before a given material is bought and installed, the status of these approvals and the date which the submission/approval needs to come by.

Managing the above documents consistently can be the difference between received products on time / finishing on time and facing delays which strain relationships and stress out individual team members. However, often when a project gets under way these material logs do not get updated properly as a team's time is spent on other financial and field-related tasks. Especially on large projects, this can lead to material procurement delays and increased risk to the project overall

# Solution

This project aims to decrease the risk of procurement mishaps / mistakes by tying together procurement and submittal logs. By identifying which materials are impacted by submittals and vice versa a team can:
- reduce duplicate data entry in these logs, leading to more managable update processes
- get a more wholistic view of what is impacting material release in one log, so action items can be more easily seen
- create logs with more customizable styling to draw attention to the most critical items at the present time
- create a data archive that can be used to determine which subcontractors, managers, and archtects submit/return items on time so future teams can look for areas to focus on
